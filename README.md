# BGS_TestTask
Test task to be reviewed by Blue Gravity Studio.

Rundown of the contents for this repo:

PrototypeProject - a Unity Project folder (where most of the non-essential files are omitted for ease of pushing and pulling). Opening this folder in Unity 2021.3.2f1 ought to yield a fully accessible project.

PrototypeBuild - once the unity project is ready to be built - likely around completion of the task - this folder will contain a full PC build of the game. Running executable from inside this folder is the intended way to play the game.

Development Description.pdf - document containing description of how implemented features work, some design commentary about them, and my own opinion on how well the task was completed. I will do my best to keep it a little less than 300 words.

Brainstorm.txt - here I will keep some notes on design as the task is open-ended and I need to think through a lot of stuff on my own. Those are not really meant to be overviewed but they're here for transparency (and my own accessibility) anyway. Anything attention-worthy from these notes will be organized and then rewritten in Development Description. Once I will no longer be using that file, I'll likely get rid of it.
